## 🎯 Project Title
**OneVillage AI: Voice-First Community Assistant for Rural India**

## 💡 The Big Idea

OneVillage AI bridges the information gap for rural citizens by providing voice-based access to government schemes, jobs, healthcare, and education—through a simple phone call or WhatsApp voice message. No app. No typing. No internet required.

## 🔥 Problem We're Solving

**70% of India lives in rural areas, yet they're digitally excluded:**

- Government schemes worth ₹10+ lakh crores go unclaimed because citizens don't know they exist
- Information is scattered across 100+ portals in English/Hindi only
- 30% rural population is illiterate—can't use text-based apps
- Only 25% have smartphones; most have basic feature phones
- Middlemen exploit this information gap, charging fees for basic guidance

**Real Impact:** A farmer eligible for PM-KISAN, crop insurance, and subsidized loans has no easy way to discover or access these benefits.

## ✨ Our Solution

A voice-first AI assistant that works like calling a knowledgeable friend:

1. **Call toll-free number** or **send WhatsApp voice message**
2. **Ask in your language**: "Mujhe kisan yojana ke baare mein batao"
3. **Get instant answers** in natural voice
4. **Receive personalized recommendations** based on your profile
5. **Step-by-step guidance** to apply for schemes

**Technology Stack:**
- Speech-to-Text (Indian accents + code-mixing)
- NLP for intent recognition
- Smart recommendation engine
- Text-to-Speech (natural Indian voices)
